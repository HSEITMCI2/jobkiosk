## Recruiter
As a Recruiter, I want to post job offers to an online portal to acquire a new focus group. Having uploaded my company's profile makes it easy to show several offers to this new group.

Being able to upload a job profile makes it easy for me, to promote offers.

To get on overview of my job offers, I can get list of all my jobs, that includes the state of acceptance, date of upload and expiration.

If a job offer is closed, I can remove the post from the portal.
