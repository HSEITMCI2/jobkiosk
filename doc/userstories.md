## Recruiter
As a Recruiter, I want to post job offers to an online portal to acquire a new focus group. Having uploaded my company's profile makes it easy to show several offers to this new group.

Being able to upload a job profile makes it easy for me, to promote offers.

Since I often have several job offers at once, I want to be able to post more than one offer.

To administer my job offers, I want to get a list thereof, including the upload date, expiration date and state of their acceptance.

Job offers should be able to be changed or deleted if requirements have changed or the position has been filled.
