# jobkiosk
Our aim is to create a simple web-application to show job ads to students at HS Esslingen.

## Idea
Job offers will can be viewed on a display at the IT department of Esslingen University of Applied Sciences.

### Companies
* register with company profile and contact name
* create job offers after registration
* can upload job offers as .pdf files
* can send job offers via e-mail to the department office
* get confirmation e-mails for every interaction

### Job offers
should contain at least:
* role title
* role category (permanent position, thesis, internship)
* location
* date

### Department office
manages job offers:
* (de-)activation
* categorization (company, date, category)

### Views
* offers sorted by company, date or category
* single offers (pdf)

### Displays
* client displays pdf
* client can switch pages and / or pdfs
